Project Title: Song Recommendation System
Objective:
The objective of this project is to build a song recommendation system that suggests songs to users based on their preferences, song similarities, or user behavior. This system can leverage user listening history, song features, or other metadata to deliver personalized recommendations.

Project Overview:
In the era of digital music streaming platforms, users are exposed to millions of songs. With such a vast catalog, it’s challenging for users to discover new music that aligns with their tastes. A song recommendation system helps users discover songs they are likely to enjoy by analyzing various data points like song attributes, user preferences, and listening behavior.

This project uses machine learning techniques to recommend songs from a dataset containing 35,000 song records. The recommendation model could be based on content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, or hybrid methods.

Dataset:
The dataset contains 35,000 rows of songs with various features, such as:

Song Title: Name of the song.
Artist: Name of the artist or band.
Genre: Genre of the song (e.g., pop, rock, jazz).
Acoustic Features: Numerical attributes like tempo, danceability, energy, loudness, etc.
Popularity: Rating or popularity score based on listening counts or likes.
Release Year: The year the song was released.
The dataset can also include user data (optional) like:

User ID: Unique ID for each user.
Song Preferences: Listened songs or liked songs for each user.
Listening History: Logs of songs users have previously listened to.
Techniques Used:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Perform an initial analysis of the dataset to understand the features and relationships between songs.
Visualize trends in genres, artists, and song attributes.
Content-Based Filtering:

This method recommends songs based on song features. For example, a user who listens to energetic songs with a fast tempo may get suggestions for songs with similar acoustic features.
Use song metadata (e.g., genre, tempo, and energy) to compute similarity scores and recommend songs that are close to what the user likes.
Collaborative Filtering:

If user data is available, collaborative filtering recommends songs based on what similar users have listened to or liked. This method leverages user-song interaction data (like ratings, likes, or play counts).
Techniques like matrix factorization or user-item similarity can be used.
Hybrid Approach:

Combine content-based and collaborative filtering to provide more robust and diverse recommendations. For example, recommend songs based on both song features and similar users’ preferences.
Machine Learning Models:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): To find songs that are similar to the ones a user prefers.
Matrix Factorization (e.g., SVD): To decompose the user-item interaction matrix and make recommendations in collaborative filtering.
Neural Networks (Optional): Deep learning methods can be used to analyze complex patterns in song attributes or user preferences.
Tools & Libraries:
Python for programming.
Pandas for data manipulation.
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms.
Surprise or LightFM for recommendation systems.
Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.
Google Colab for model development (handling memory issues by optimizing data loading).
Streamlit or Flask (optional) to deploy the recommendation engine as a web app.
Challenges:
Memory Management: Since the dataset is large, running the recommendation system on platforms like Google Colab might result in memory issues. Proper handling and optimization techniques, such as mini-batch processing or feature selection, can address these issues.
Cold Start Problem: New users or new songs without prior data may not receive accurate recommendations. This can be mitigated by using content-based filtering.
Expected Outcome:
The system will output a list of song recommendations based on user input or song similarity. These recommendations should align with the user’s preferences, and the system should offer diverse and relevant song suggestions.
